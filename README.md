# Efficient-Patient-Treatment-Scheduler-Using-SRTF-Algorithm
This project implements a real-time patient treatment scheduler using the Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) scheduling algorithm. The system is designed for a hospital environment where multiple patients arrive at different times, and treatment is given based on the shortest remaining time to completion.

# Key Features:
- Allows patients to be added dynamically.
- Uses SRTF scheduling to prioritize patients with the shortest treatment time.
- Simulates real-time processing using sleep delays.
- Displays completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time for each patient.
- Computes average turnaround time (TAT) and waiting time (WT).

# How It Works:
- Patients enter their arrival time and treatment time into the system.
- The system schedules treatments based on SRTF, treating the patient with the least remaining time first.
- After treatment, it calculates and displays patient statistics.
- The system also provides average turnaround and waiting times for performance evaluation.

# Use Case:
Hospitals can use this scheduling system to efficiently manage patient treatments and reduce waiting time, ensuring fair and optimal healthcare delivery.
